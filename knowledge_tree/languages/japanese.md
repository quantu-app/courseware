# Japanese

Japanese language learning curriculum.

## Stage 1: ひらがな、カタカナ
1. Learn to read/write/pronounce ひらがな.
2. Learn to read/write/pronounce カタカナ.

## Kanji Approach
1. Learn to read/write/pronounce radicals and use them to write Kanji.
2. For each Kanji learn:
    - Meaning
    - Pronunciation: Onyomi, kunyomi
    - Radical composition
    - Etymology
    - Story (for remembering)
    - Strokes
    - Common Words using the Kanji
    - Common Sentences using the Kanji


## Japanese Levels: JLPT

We could orient our curriculum around the JLPT starting with level N5 and moving up through level N1.
This would ensure we could cover all/most kanji, grammar, and vocabulary used on the standard Japanese language tests.
