# BA - Religious Studies: Core

This is the base template for studying religions at an undergraduate level. It is designed to give the student a broad foundational knowledge in year 1. Throughout the program the religious aspects are augmented by courses in psychology and philosophy which deal heavily with ethics and how the mind and human beings function - core themes for most religions.

Starting in year 2, but especially in years 3 and 4, this core template should be filled in with courses related to the student's specialization area. For instance, a student of Jewish Studies would begin taking required courses for that major such as Judaism and Jewish History in year 2 and continue with the core courses as well as Jewish Studies electives through years 3 and 4.
